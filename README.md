# Hey, Welcome to Cocktail Maker

In this small application we retrieve data from a third party API and get some instruction of how to make a differnt cocktail drink. this app is already been created before with vanilla JavaScript

- This app contains three different pages

1. Home page: where user can get a drink by first letter.

2. Random page: In this page user can get a random drink by clicking on the button.

3. Serach page: In this page user can get drink by searching the drink name.

It took me a few days to create this small application, but now it is done.
